I am a third year graduate student in the Computer Science department of University of Maryland, specifically the [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Andrew Childs](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/). I am interested in both the potential and the limitations of quantum computers, and my work aims at studying this question rigorously. Topics of interest include Algorithms, Cryptography, Complexity, and their Quantum analogs.

Recently, I have been especially interested in understanding quantum algorithms that query random permutations. We have very few tools for proving lower bounds on such algorithms, despite their relevance in cryptography. One noteworthy example is in our understanding of the Sponge construction. This construction underlies the widely used hash function SHA3, and yet we know almost nothing about its post-quantum security. My work aims to address this gap.

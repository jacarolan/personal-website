I am a third year graduate student in the Computer Science department of University of Maryland, specifically the [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Andrew Childs](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/). I am interested in both the potential and the limitations of quantum computers, and my work aims at studying this question rigorously. Topics of interest include Algorithms, Cryptography, Complexity, and their Quantum analogs.

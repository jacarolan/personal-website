I am a third year graduate student in the Computer Science department of University of Maryland, specifically the [Joint Center for Quantum Information and Computer Science](https://quics.umd.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Andrew Childs](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~amchilds/). I am currently an intern at [NTT Research](https://cis.ntt-research.com/) in the Cryptography and Information Security lab, hosted by [Dakshita Khurana](https://www.dakshitakhurana.com/).

My research addresses both the potential and limitations of quantum computers, primarily through the lens of theoretical computer science. I am especially interested in quantum query complexity, and its connections to algorithms and cryptography.
